# Watershed_delineator

The code can delineate the watershed from the DEM without manually creating pour points. Instead of pour points, the code creates the points at the intersection of stream and uses it as the pour points. The user must define the interval value to generate the stream and non stream raster and the steam order to determine the size of watershed
